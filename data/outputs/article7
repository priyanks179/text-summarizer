Uncertainty over "Brexit" deepened Thursday when a court ruled that Britain's government can't trigger the process of withdrawal from the European Union without approval from parliament a decision that could scupper the entire process.
May has repeatedly promised to respect the outcome of the referendum and indicated she would trigger Article 50  the two-year process of negotiations toward EU withdrawal  by the end of March 2017.
However, her government will now appeal Thursday's ruling, which could leave her Brexit timetable in tatters.
British prime ministers can use the historic power of royal prerogative to make decisions on foreign affairs, such as withdrawal from treaties, without a parliamentary vote.
Campaigners filed a court challenge, arguing that leaving the EU would remove rights of employment and free movement  a change serious enough to require the approval of parliament.
May says those terms won't be known until the negotiation process begins.
The pound has lost almost one fifth its value against the dollar since June.
Minutes after Thursday's decision, the pound rose back up by 1.1 percent to $1.
The judges said their ruling was purely a question of law, not politics.
"The court is not concerned with and does not express any view about the merits of leaving the European Union: that is a political issue," the judgement said.
"We will appeal this judgment," the U.K. government said in a statement.
It was the second embarrassment for May in less than 24 hours."
I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand … I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50," he said.
"If this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke".
"The majority of the parliamentary Conservative Party now wants to get on with implementing the outcome of the referendum, regardless of which side they were on in the campaign.
A pleasantly surprising number of Labour MPs have also taken on board the message from their Leave-voting constituencies.
Having gone through the unpleasant experience of being at loggerheads with their voters on the doorstep, they rightly don't want to defy them now they have spoken".
