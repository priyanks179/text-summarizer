One sweltering afternoon last January on a film set in the Cambodian countryside, a local man approached Angelina Jolie with a large bucket of leeches.
As it started to gorge on her blood, she carried it over to her nine-year-old lead actor, Sareum Srey Moch, who was sitting in a canvas chair in the shade of a tree.
Sareum wrinkled her nose and stared at the leech.
Jolie’s 13-year-old son, Pax, on crutches after breaking his foot in a jet-ski accident, hobbled over with his camera to take a closer look.
“Yes it sucks your blood,” Jolie answered after a slight hesitation, already resigned to the likelihood that live leeches might be a step too far for this young actor.
She ordered a return to plan A, a box full of dozens of pretend leeches made out of black vinyl and double-pinned to a cardboard backing like biological specimens.
Actor and director high-fived each other and the girl walked back to the paddy field for her next scene.
Over the next four years, they drove its population out into the countryside, executing all those perceived as class enemies.
More than two million people were killed, out of a total population of seven million.
At 30, she wrote her autobiography, First They Killed My Father.
The two women have been friends for 16 years and Ung, who co-wrote the screenplay, was working as a consultant on the set.
In that film, which was released in 2001, Cambodia was no more than an exotic backdrop for the action, but booby-traps and anti-personnel mines planted all over the country in the 1970s were still going off.
She started giving large amounts of money to UNHCR and became a goodwill ambassador for the organisation.
Ung at that time was working for a US Vietnam veterans’ organisation supporting landmine victims in the region.
As soon as Jolie read the book she called Ung.“We travelled to some very remote areas – there were no roads, or hotels or restaurants,” Ung said.
And I was so impressed because Angie didn’t travel with an entourage.
Ung taught Jolie the survival skills learned in the camp: how to check for leeches and catch frogs.
“We very quickly became friends,” Jolie told me.
One day, Jolie spent time playing and talking to children in a school in Battambang.
And she was very supportive about it,” Jolie said.
“And we had a talk about what would be important, to make sure he always knew about himself”.
“He was the one who just called it and said he was ready and that he wanted to work on it, which he did.He read the script, helped with notes, and was in the production meetings,” Jolie said.
You have to make it in Thailand, like The Killing Fields,” Jolie said.Jolie’s film makes no such concessions.
The cast and crew are Cambodian.
Jolie’s humanitarian work marks the third act of her career.
Although not the first actor to take this route, she has thrown herself into the role.
“Not walking away from it all, but ideally doing projects like this one, where you can pull together all that matters to you at the same time”.
It was mid-morning and the heat was still bearable.
The atmosphere was of a sprawling, busy, extended family, particularly during the communal meals eaten under canvas.
She was clearly in her preferred element, at work but surrounded by close friends and family, and protected – by the remoteness of location and light set security  from the world’s curiosity about her private life.
“Maybe they’ve seen Tomb Raider but they don’t really watch a lot of movies,” she said.
If I go to the market, they do recognise me – they just don’t bother me.
They say hi”.Long lines of young Khmer children in black pyjamas and red chequered bandanas marched up and down, in and out of shot.Others picked rice from a paddy as a drone camera hovered noisily above.
