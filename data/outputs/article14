“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”.
It is not easy to define corruption.
But in a narrow sense, corruption is mostly concerned with ‘bribery’ and it takes several forms.
Corruption is a global phenomenon and it is omnipresent.Corruption has progressively increased and is now rampant in our society.
Corruption in India is a consequence of the nexus between Bureaucracy, politics and criminals.
India is now no longer considered a soft state.
It has now become a consideration state where everything can be had for a consideration.
India is among 55 of the 106 countries where corruption is rampant, according to the Corruption Perception Index 2004 Report released by Transparency International India.
·In a highly inflationary economy, low salaries of government officials compel them to resort to the road of corruption.
Graduates from IIMs with no experience draw a far handsome salary than what government secretaries draw.
· Complex laws and procedures alienate common people to ask for any help from government.
· Election time is a time when corruption is at its peak level.
Big industrialist fund politicians to meet high cost of election and ultimately to seek personal favour.
Bribery to politicians buys influence, and bribery by politicians buys votes.
In order to get elected, politicians bribe poor illiterate people, who are slogging for two times’ meal.

Corruption is a cancer, which every Indian must strive to cure.
Many new leaders when come into power declare their determination to eradicate corruption but soon they themselves become corrupt and start amassing huge wealth.
There are many myths about corruption, which have to be exploded if we really want to combat it.
Some of these myths are: Corruption is a way of life and nothing can be done about it.
Only people from underdeveloped or developing countries are prone to corruption.
We will have to guard against all these crude fallacies while planning measures to fight corruption.
· Foolproof laws should be made so that there is no room for discretion for politicians and bureaucrats.
The role of the politician should be minimized.
Application of the evolved policies should be left in the hands of independent commission or authority in each area of public interest.
It may not be possible to root out corruption completely at all levels but it is possible to contain it within tolerable limits.
Honest and dedicated persons in public life, control over electoral expenses could be the most important prescriptions to combat corruption.
Corruption has a corrosive impact on our economy.
It worsens our image in international market and leads to loss of overseas opportunities.
