Global warming is an increase in the average temperature of the earth’s temperature, especially a sustained change sufficient to cause climate change.
The average facade temperature of the globe has increased more than degree since 1900 and the speed of warming has been almost three folds the century long average since 1970.
More or less all specialists studying the climate record of the earth have the same opinion now that human actions, mainly the discharge of green house gases from smokestacks, vehicles, and burning forests, are perhaps the leading power driving the fashion.
Based on the study on past climate shifts, notes of current situations, and computer simulations, many climate scientists say that lacking of big curbs in greenhouse gas discharges, the 21st century might see temperatures rise of about 3 to 8 degrees, climate patterns piercingly shift, ice sheets contract and seas rise several feet.
The major cause of global warming is the release of green house gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide etc into the atmosphere.About twenty percent of carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere comes from burning of gasoline in the engines of the vehicles.
Building of these structures require a lot of fuel to be burnt which emits a large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Methane is obtained from resources such as rice paddies, bovine flatulence, bacteria in bogs and fossil fuel manufacture.
Another cause of global warming is deforestation that is caused by cutting and burning of forests for the purpose of residence and industrialisation.
The effect of global warming is increasing the average temperature of the earth.
Other consequences may comprise of higher or lower agricultural outputs, glacier melting, lesser summer stream flows, genus extinctions and rise in the ranges of disease vectors.
As an effect of global warming various new diseases have emerged lately.
The global warming is expected to cause irreversible changes in the ecosystem and the behaviour of animals.
Global warming might result in birds finding a more permanent home in northern areas in the Northern Hemisphere.
Likewise, earlier one more team of scientists reported that in a single year Greenland witnessed 32 glacial earthquakes between 4.1 on the Richter scale.
This is a disturbing sign and points that a huge destabilisation that may now be in progress deep within the second biggest growth of ice on the planet.
Each day passing brings yet new proof that we are now in front of a global emergency, a climate emergency that needs instant action to shrilly decrease carbon dioxide emissions worldwide in order to turn down the earth’s rising temperatures and avoid any calamity.
Even though most predictions focus on the epoch up to 2100, even if no further greenhouse gases were discharged after this date, global warming and sea level would be likely to go on to rise for more than a millennium, since carbon dioxide has a long average atmospheric life span.
One such effort is the Kyoto agreement that has been made between various nations to reduce the emissions of various green house gases.
A1 Gore was one of the foremost U.S. politicians to heave an alarm about the hazards of global warming.He has warned people about the ill effects of Global warming and its remedies.
Future predictions do not look good for this planet if nothing is done soon.
