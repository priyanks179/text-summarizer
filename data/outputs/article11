Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events is not — despite what Wikipedia will tell you — a television series.
It's Harry Potter meets Clue.
It's a cozy story on a rainy night.
No such structure is present here.
In this story not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning, and very few happy things in the middle".
The eight-episode adaptation covers four of Daniel Handler's popular Lemony Snicket books about the three Baudelaire children — Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny — whose parents died in a fire.
In his zeal to find them a guardian, he never heeds the children's warnings; specifically, he fails to appreciate that their "enormous fortune"  has made them the target of their distant relation Count Olaf , an appallingly poor actor and the series villain.
This is the cycle that, every two episodes, repeats.
That seasickness in the storytelling might explain the Netflix adaptation's funny math: two episodes = one book; four books = one season.
It's a jarring way to carve up the plot. That expectation lurches to a halt.
So is the series' amusing habit of weaving in commentary from the narrator , usually through pessimistic vocabulary lessons that darkly remind you that this will end badly.
Then A Series of Unfortunate Events teases us with clues and symbols and talk of secret societies and — most audaciously — cuts to an adventurous "Mother" and "Father" who have escaped imprisonment and are trying to work their way back to their children.
But Lemony Snicket's warnings turn out to be true.TV shows used to be consumed on a weekly basis.
If "binge-watching" aptly describes our new habits of consumption, it's because the term recognizes — without judgment — that there are significant differences between the pleasures of drinking a glass vs.
A Series of Unfortunate Events just wouldn't have worked as a weekly series — the part one-part two structure would have annoyed viewers who couldn't continue eagerly on, treating the credits at the end of part one as the streaming equivalent of a commercial break.
People being people — draining the bottle whenever they can — Netflix began to adjust its programming to this new way of watching.And yes: Sometimes the results are baggy or odd.
Sometimes traditional shows morph into peculiar formal experiments, as the Gilmore Girls revival did with its four 90-minute episodes.
The payoff is that a Netflix show — not being television — can really think about how messing with form and delivery affects its storytelling.I can easily believe that's a deliberate effect; this is a narrative that constantly thinks aloud about the viewer, after all.
"Every single episode is nothing but dismay, so look away.But you don't, and you have no one but yourself to blame for your bad mood.
