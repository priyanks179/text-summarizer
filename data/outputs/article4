"It's been a very positive couple of days for the team," BAS officials posted on the organization's Facebook page on Dec 31.
"Last night they managed to successfully tow the first of the eight Halley modules to the new site at Halley 6a".
Each of its main modules is equipped with hydraulic legs and skis, but this is the first time they have been moved since the new base became operational in 2012.
The Brunt Ice Shelf is typically around 490 feet  thick.
But scientists have learned that a long-dormant chasm in the ice southeast of the base is now growing by more than 1 mile each year, and threatens to eventually cut the base off from the inland section of the ice shelf.
"Each summer season is very short — about nine weeks," BAS operations director Tim Stockings said in a statement.
"And because the ice and the weather are unpredictable, we have to be flexible in our approach".
We are especially keen to minimize the disruption to the science programs.
"We have planned the move in stages  the science infrastructure that captures environmental data will remain in place while the station's modules move," Stockings said.
Over the winter months, a few staff members keep the base operational and the experiments running.
