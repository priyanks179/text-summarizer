Terrorism is the process unfair and violent activities performed by the group of trained people called terrorists.
There is only one boss who gives strict orders to the group to perform particular activity in any ways.
Group of terrorist also take support of the media by especially contacting them to let them know about their plan, ideas and goals.
Acts of terrorism affects the human mind to a great extent and makes people so fear that they fear to go outside from their own home.
They think that there is terror everywhere outside the home in the crowd like railway station, temple, social event, national event and so many.
Some recent act of terrorism are 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and 26/11 attack in India.All the places which are crowded because of any reasons like social programmes, national events like Republic day, Independence Day, temple and etc.
Even after arrangement of such tight security, we are still unable to make it effective against the terrorism.
They are very common people like us but they are trained to complete some unfair act and forced to fight against their one society, family and country.
As an Indian citizen, we all are highly responsible to stop the terrorism and it can be stopped only when we never come into the greedy talk of some bad and frustrated people.
