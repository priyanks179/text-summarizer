Police in riot gear shot rubber bullets and used pepper spray on demonstrators  who call themselves water protectors on the shoreline of the Cantapeta Creek, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation here on Wednesday.
A confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site.
"I was shot in point blank range," said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover.
"Another water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him".
In a press release, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said it used "less than lethal ammunition to control the situation" when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line.
"Officers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers," the release said.
Even as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police.
Today, the Department says The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass.
"I was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back.
It obliterated me," said Schrode.
"I turned around and I had no idea what just happened.
And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat".
Morton County called the situation a "standoff" and, in a press release, stated that "protesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws".
People are getting hurt, people are getting shot with rubber bullets, people are getting maced, and Obama is not stepping in," said Fox in a phone interview, referring to a recent interview with NowThis in which the president said he would let the situation "play out for several more weeks".
