Corruption free government is not a necessary condition for rapid economic development.
Swaminathan Corruption in any form is treated as an incurable disease, a cause of many social and economical evils in the society and it damages the moral and ethical fibres of the civilization.
Indisputably, it is correct that corruption breeds many evils in the society and once corruption starts taking place, slowly and gradually whole country passes through its net and it becomes after sometime an incurable disease.
From the point of view of economic growth, there seems to be no clear cut correlation between corruption and the economic growth of a country.
There may be presence of some social maladies like inequality of income among the people, moral degradation of people due to the prevalence of corruption, but the parameters of economic growth which are taken on percentage or an average basis are entirely different can find several countries having corrupt regime but yielding excellent economic results and other countries with clean regime showing very poor results in terms of economic prosperity and growth.
Transparency International publishes every year lists ranking corruption in various countries.
It has just come up with a list of the 10 most corrupt rulers; According to reasonably authoritative local estimates," Numerous Uno is Indonesia's 'Suharto' who is estimated to have skimmed off $15-35 billion.
This list is neither complete nor exhaustive.
Marcos and Fujimori tried to rebuild the collapsing economies amidst lot of praise for their efforts, but the prevailing corruption and maladministration eroded the initial gains seriously.
If we look at transparency international's list of 133 countries ranked.
In order of corruption, we will find that the well-off western countries all figure in the top of 35.
Singapore, the most successful developing country, ranks at 5, Botswana Africa star performer, ranks at 30, the Scandinavians are generally regarded the most honest and the USA comes a bit lower at 18.
Paradoxically, some of the poorer countries are also among the most corrupt and some of the less corrupt are progressing.
Again it is difficult to find any correlation between corruption and economic growth.
The puzzle to ponder is why does corruption coexist with both good and bad economic performance?Why has India over the decades grown more slowly than Indonesia despite less corruption?
A survey conducted for World Development Report some years ago, find one answer.
Businessmen in surveyed countries said that the main problem with corruption was that it increases risks and uncertainties.The risks declined dramatically, if corruption produced reliable outcome .
If all players have to pay 10 percent and could sure of getting their licenses entrepreneurs could treat this as just one more tax, factor it into their calculations of profit and so could invest with confidence of sure gain.
Most businessman fear the arbitrariness where some entrepreneurs pay huge sums in vain, while others pay little or nothing and succeed.
This happens when there is much discretion in decision making.
Finally, the quality of institutions seems to be the most important factor for the growth of a country.
If the institutions work even moderately well, progress is possible even if money is skimmed off at the top.
But if the institutions are incapable of enforcing any rights, corruption will hasten economic collapse.
So far Indian economy is concerned the slow progress is the result of lack of decision making at higher levels.
Many politicians who takes money but could not enforce their will because of powerful lobby of bureaucrats at many places and in a democracy like India, voice of media, voice of opposition could suppress the wish of the leader.
Ours is a peculiar democracy where politicians are corrupt but not authoritative, ours is a multi-party system where leg pulling for no cause, accusation without any evidence is common.
Instability in political system is also responsible for the slow economic progress where the Prime Minister is always busy in satiating the coalition partners to keep attached.
So far quality of institutions are concerned we are having well matured corporate and the fast development reflected during the last years, has brought stability in the country and good relations with the neighboring nations.
